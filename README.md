# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. Players take turns to make a move, and the game checks for a winner or a tie after each move.

## How to Play

1. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` script.
2. Players will be prompted to enter the row (0, 1, or 2) and column (0, 1, or 2) to make a move.
3. The game alternates between 'X' and 'O' players until there is a winner or a tie.
4. The game board is displayed after each move.

## Running the Game

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```
## Example Gameplay
